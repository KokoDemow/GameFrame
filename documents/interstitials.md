# Add advertisement interstitials to your App
Interstitials are fullscreen advertiesements, that pop-up when the Game flow naturally stops. Let's face it: You can money with them, but they're annoying for the player. Google has this text of how to live without Interstitals [here](). I think this says it all.
Nevertheless, my games use interstitials an they're available in **GameFrame**. All you have to do is set a flag to `true` when leaving a level. Then **GameFrame** is showing it, if it is available and all other conditions are met. 

## Setup Google's AdMob

## Show the interstitial
Only when level is left

### A thought, when to show interstitals
Like advertisement in television.

## Test and production
